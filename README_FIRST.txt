The code presented in the above files is created mostly
by Dr Christian Urban, Lecturer at King's College London.

I, Horia Tudor Pavel Simon, am a student at King's College London
and have been taught by Christian in my second year(PEP -- see
assignment2018(6-10)-Horiapavel98 folders) and in my third year
(Compilers module -- cw(1-4)).

Most of the code in these files is written by Dr. Christian Urban
and the credit should be mostly assigned to him. I, as his student,
am responsible for parts of the code that fulfilled the coursework
requirements.
